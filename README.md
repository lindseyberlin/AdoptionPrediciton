# Adoption Prediction Tool

This project used data from the Austin Animal Center to predict whether an animal is likely to be adopted or not. This tool was built and deployed to demonstrate and teach how to use Heroku to deploy Streamlit apps which utilize a saved scikit-learn model to make predictions from user inputs.

## Data

The data is a blend of both [intakes](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Intakes/wter-evkm/) and [outcomes](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238) data from the Austin Animal Center, downloaded on August 4 2022.
